# Backgorund

At first, I was using gitosis for Lifthub. When I decided to migrate it onto Amazon EC2, I was thinking that I should use something new, and decided to try gitorious, which I had heard about a bit. I didn't have any specific reasons to switch from gitosis.

# Goal

What I want to do is to manage users and repositories from the command line. That's it. Maybe, I might need fancier features later on, though.

# License

Gitorious is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License (ver. 3). You can get it from the site below:

The same license applies to the scripts in this rpository (gitorious-script).
